  <b><h5>About the Website:</b></h5> This website has been created to document my project for the Into to Digital Fabrication (PHYS-S12) course at Harvard University. This website is meant to give a thorough documentation such that anyone can recreate my project if needed.

  <b><h5>About me:</b></h5> I am a high school student from India currently studying at Welham Boys' School in Dehradun, an all boys residential school. 

  Originally from Chandigarh, I am looking to develop a career in Engineering and Technology. Within the various fields of Engineering, Material Science, Aeronautical Engineering, and Civil Engineering interest me the most. 

  Other than tech, my interests include competitive swimming, adventure sports, writing for my blog, and more. 

  I am currently looking for research opportunities and internships in the field of Math and Engineering.
