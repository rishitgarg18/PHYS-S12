  ### Week 1: 2-D Laser Cutting 

  
 Laser cutting works by focusing the output of a high-power laser through optics at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas.

 I first used Fusion 360 software to map images and then created various stuctures using pressfit construction. A pressfit kit is a construction kit held together with only friction and topology. It serves as an excellent introductory activity for a novice mechanical designer.

 This week assignment was done using hexagonal and square images (each equipped with a respective kerf and a notch). These images were prepared using Fusion 360 software. 
 
 After the images were mapped on a software, they were then cut through pieces of cardboard using a laser cutter. The resultant smaller structures were then used to make bigger structures using pressfit kit construction.
