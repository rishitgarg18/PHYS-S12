  ### Week 1: Final Project Proposal 

  Here is an image: 

  ![Shoe_sole image](Shoe_sole.png)

  Combining my interests in both running and engineering, I am keen to pursue a final project that involves working on the textile and materials that are used by athletes.

  More specifically, I would like to understand the materials from which basic running apparel is made and what the merits and demerits of these materials are. I would then like to work on the soles of the standard running shoes that runners use today. I am interested in creating a sole that could map the daily foot movements of the user and using that data, could smartly allow the sole to support the runnerâ€™s feet in the most appropriate way. For example, a person with a dominant heel strike applies more pressure on the heel of the shoe than someone with a dominant toe strike. The modified sole would attempt to interpret this information and give cushioning to runners of both nature as needed.

  What would also be interesting to explore is if the sole of the shoe can be modified to distinguish between movements such as walking, jogging, running, and sprinting. 

  Along with working on the sole of the shoe, the project could also work on the textiles which are used in the upper regions of the shoe. I am interested in seeing if we could use 3-D printing on existing fabric (and explore other materials too) to come up with something that could benefit the runner.
