  ### Week 3: Electronics and Tools
 This week's assignment involved working on a kinetic sculpture and using circutry inside a kinetic sculpture. We used basic concepts of Electronics (such as Power, Voltage, Current, etc.) and various tools in the Science Makerspace to come up with what we wanted to.

 
 I used the Fusion 360 to map out my drawings on the software. Then, using a laser cutter, these images were cut on cardboard. I used this method to get the basic structure of the my car's body.<br>

 Next, I used various cutters and saws to shape out my car's body by hand. Finally, I fixated my car's body using super glue and some masking tape. The masking tape used was brown in color so that it could camouflage with the colour of the cardboard.

 Finally, to power my car, I used a fan (which was powered by a motor) as that was the easiest thing to do. As I try to improve on this model, I can try to use bigger fans or even attach motors directly to the wheels of the car for better functionality. The motor used for this week's assignment was a Canon Motor with a fan-like structure made at its end using just simple masking tape. Before, considering a Canon Motor, I thought of other motors as well, images if which you can see below:

 Further, using the next week's assignment, we will have the opportunity to work on these models using even more sophisticated methods, such as Microcontroller programing, working with an Arduino, and much more. The Car that I made using this week's assignment is set to see a lot of improvement as the weeks progress. In particular, the fan of the car (the power source) needs a lot of work and probably a fan made out of masking tape may not have been the best idea.
