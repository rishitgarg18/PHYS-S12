  ### Week 8: 2-D CNC Milling, Molding, and Casting 

  
 <h2> 1. CNC Milling </h2> 
 For this week's assignment, I milled a monogram of the letter 'R', which is the first letter of my name. I used the Shopbot machine to do so but also gained experience with setting up the Wax Machine. Here are some photos and videos from the CNC Milling:

 Because this assignment was my first experience with the Aspire software (the Aspire software is needed to work on the Shopbot machine). I reffered to the instructions on the following website to come up with my assignment:

 I molded a 'Dorito' piece in silicone for this part of the assignment. This was done in the hope of creating a 'chocolate layered Dorito'. After molding the Dorito piece, I tried to cast the the 'Dorito' with some dark chocolate. In order to do so, one needs to keep in mind that you should always select the chocolate with the least amount of sugars and preservatives in it. The more the amount of preservatives, the more difficult it is to melt the chocolate. Further, one should also be careful about the way they melt the chocolate. I once tried melting the chocolate with a paper plate beneath it in a microwave and the plate itself burned. Here are a photos demonstarting my work in molding and casting:

 I would recommend using this link for a quick insight into molding and casting:

 Lastly, I would like to give credits for the dxf file with the monogram 'R':
