  ### Week 5: 3-D Printing and Design
 In this week's assignment, we worked on Fusion 360 to create any design of our choice, which was then to be sent to the Prusa Slicer application as an STL file. The goal was to 3-D print anything that could not be made otherwise using subtractive methods.

 I designed a spin top, which is basically an entire figure that spins off an axis at its base. Using the basic concept of Volumes of Revolution (I learnt these in a Calculus course), I first created a rectangle with its diagonals marked and then revolved it around one of the axes. From the figure that I obtained, I had cone-like structures coming out from both the top and the bottom. Finally, I cut out the cone from the top so that my resultant design has only once cone at the bottom which serves as the axis of rotation for the spin top.

 Following are some screenshots from the Fusion 360 and the Prusa Slicer applications:

 Here are some of the videos and photos from the 3-D printing session itself:

 Another goal this week was to use a Photogrammetry application to scan a 3-D model of any item. I used an application called Polycam to scan various shoes as I am going to be working closely with shoes and soles for my final project. Here are the results:
